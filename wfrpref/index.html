                Character creation is fairly straightforward, and shouldn't be feared. Additionally, just about all of
                the mechanical aspects can be randomized; doing so gives an exp bonus that can be spent at the end of
                character creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your character will have a species (Human, Halfling, Dwarf, High Elf, Wood Elf) which determines the
                careers, endeavours, etc. available to you; a class and career &mdash; <em>e.g.</em> Peasant (Trapper)
                &mdash; that determines your status, advancements, talents, trappings, income endeavour; a set of skills
                and talents; trappings (personal property and gear); and a motivation.

            <div>
                <p>Attributes describe your characterâ€™s innate capabilities â€“ how fast
                    or strong you are, how much damage you can sustain, or how well
                    you cope with stressful situations. Attributes include Movement,
                    ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience.
                </p>
                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests to determine if you perform an action successfully. The
                    Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted,
                    or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most
                    dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own
                    strengths and weaknesses, so their
                    averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p>
                <h4>Determining Characteristics</h4>
                <p>
                    When determining your Characteristics:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 1)</b> Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and
                    make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be
                    improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results
                    between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with
                    your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each
                    Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your
                    Character Sheet and gain +50 XP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 2)</b> Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning
                    each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If
                    youâ€™re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character
                    Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 3)</b> If youâ€™re still not happy with your results, either roll again
                    and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore
                    the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10
                    Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum
                    of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from
                    the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like
                    rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Turn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers. Look to
                    the Advance Scheme and find the three Characteristics marked
                    <eh>â˜©</eh> without a brass, silver, or gold background. <b>You can allocate a
                        total of 5 Advances across these Characteristics as you choose</b>,
                    and mark them in the Advances box on your Character Sheet.

                <p>
                    <b>Weapon Skill (WS): </b>Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a
                    measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed
                    melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is
                    the weapon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ballistic Skill (BS): </b>Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and
                    throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used
                    as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Strength (S): </b>How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and
                    how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Toughness (T): </b>Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat
                    but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and
                    standing up to poison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Initiative (I): </b>Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and
                    when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you
                    be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of
                    intuition and perception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Agility (Ag): </b>Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for
                    things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for
                    dodging blows in combat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dexterity (Dex): </b>Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like
                    playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also
                    help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Intelligence (Int): </b>Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful
                    for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the
                    understanding and casting of magical spells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Willpower (WP): </b>General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty
                    and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all
                    sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Fellowship (Fel): </b>Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally
                    pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or
                    commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting
                    to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with
                    your deity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Wounds (W): </b>Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on
                    your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury.<br />
                    Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength
                    Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus, and Willpower Bonus
                    (abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer
                    to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses
                    used to calculate your Wounds. Note: Halflings have the Small
                    Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see page 341).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Fate and Resilience: </b>You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have
                    a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes
                    as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes
                    Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are.
                    By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through
                    any situation.
                    <br />
                    Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate. Your initial Resolve
                    equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.

                <h3>Skill and Talent Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Skills represent areas of trained learning or experience, and
                    Talents describe special abilities your Character can access. A
                    list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills
                    and Talents. The Skills and Talents you have available to you at
                    character generation are determined by your Species and Career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you
                    gain in the Advances box of the Skill. If you should learn this
                    skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a
                    new number of Advances. If you learn a Talent, record it in your
                    Talent list on your Character Sheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skills are classified as either Basic or Advanced. Basic Skills
                    represent common abilities that everyone can perform â€” you can
                    use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal
                    to the governing characteristic. Advanced Skills require specialist
                    knowledge, and you can only use these skills if you have taken at
                    least one Advance in them.
                </p>
                <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-yellow w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-yellow">
                    <p>
                        Note: Some Talents can be learned multiple times. If you have
                        an opportunity to learn a Talent a second time, check the Talent
                        entry in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents to see if it can be learned
                        multiple times, and mark how many times youâ€™ve learned it on
                        your Character Sheet.

            <h3>Species Skills and Talents</h3>
            <p>
                Each Species has a variety of Skills and Talents to choose from.
                <b>You may choose 3 Skills to gain 5 Advances each, and 3 Skills
                    to gain 3 Advances each.</b> If a Talent listing presents a choice, you
                select one Talent from the choices given. Any Random Talents are
                determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you
                already have, you may reroll. Note: All Characters are assumed to
                be fluent in Reikspiel,, the language of the Empire, and do not
                need to take it as a Skill. For more on this, see page 124.

            <p>
                Now turn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers. You
                begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path. There are
                8 Skills and 4 Talents listed with that level, and you can choose
                which of these you are most proficient at. <eh>Allocate 40 Advances
                    to your eight starting Skills, with no more than 10 Advances
                    allocated to any single Skill at this stage</eh>. This is enough for you
                to add 5 Advances to every Career Skill if you wish, which is one
                of the required steps to complete your Career if you wish to move
                to a new one (see Changing Career on page 48). <eh>You may also
                    choose a single Talent from your career to learn.</eh>
