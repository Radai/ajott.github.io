            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Combat follows these steps:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Determine Surprise: </b>Generally characters would only be <condition>Surprised</condition> in
                    the first round of combat.</li>
                <li><b>Round Begins: </b>If a rule states that something happens "at the start of the Round," it happens
                    now.</li>
                <li><b>Characters take Turns: </b>Each combatant takes a Turn in Initiative order, starting with the
                    highest Initiative. <eh>Each Character can usually perform one Move and one Action per Turn</eh>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Round Ends: </b>The Round ends when all characters have taken their turns. If a rule states that
                    something happens "at the end of the Round," it happens now.</li>
                <li><b>Repeat 2-5 As Required: </b>Continue to play through Rounds until the combat is resolved.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Initiative Order</h3>
            <p>Characters act in Initiative order during Rounds, with the highest Initiative acting first. If multiple
                characters have the same Initiative Characteristic, Agility is used as a tiebreaker. If they have the
                same Agility, roll an <b>Opposed Agility Test</b>, with the winner choosing who among the tied
                combatants goes first.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
            <h3>Surprise</h3>
            <p>Taking an enemy by surprise provides a big advantage. If one side is planning an attack, they can attempt
                to harness the element of surprise by:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hiding: </b>Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover.</li>
                <li><b>Sneaky Tactics: </b>Attack from behind, in the dark, through heavy fog, or from above.</li>
                <li><b>Distractions: </b>Loud bangs, milling crowds, and an especially engaging sermon could harbour a
                    surprise attack!</li>
                <li><b>Unprepared Defenders: </b>If the enemy are particularly unwary, the attackers automatically
                    surprise their targets.</li>
                <li><b>Something Else: </b>Other sneaky and ingenious plans concocted by cunning players.</li>
            </ul>
            If there is a chance that the ambushers will be detected, the GM may call for an <b>Opposed Stealth vs
                Perception Test</b>, usually with the character with the worst <skill>Stealth</skill> opposing all
            potential spotters. If the ambusher wins, each defeated character gains the <condition>Surprised</condition>
            Condition.
            </p>
            <p>If anyone is surpised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the <condition>Surprised</condition>
                Condition.</p>

        <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Characters generally have one Move and one Action per turn, and can take them in any order - often,
                you'll be doing both at once. Skipping one or the other will not cause it to carry over to another
                Round, however.
            </p>
            <h3>Action</h3>
            <p>
                The most common use of an Action in combat will be to Attack, though several Skills and Talents may have
                relevant Actions associated with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Melee: </b>To make an attack, perform an <b>Opposed <skill>Melee</skill> Test</b> vs. your opponent; whomever scores
                the highest SL wins. If you win the test, you hit your oppenent and gain +1 Advantage. If you lose the
                Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and your Action is finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Ranged: </b>Roll a <b><skill>Ranged</skill> Test</b> for the weapon you're using. Remember, if you Move before
                shooting, the test may be more difficult. If you are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1
                Advantage. If you fail, your Action is over. Your opponent doesn't gain Advantage in ranged combat.
            </p>
            <h4>Criticals and Fumbles</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Criticals and Fumbles: </b>When making a Test for an Attack, rolling doubles causes a Critical (if
                you succeeded on the Test) or a Fumble (if you failed).
                <br />If you score a critical on a Melee Test, you automatically cause a Critical Wound to your
                opponent; this occurs even if you were the defender in the attack. Beyond that, damage is calculated as
                normal.
                <br />If you fumble, your attack has failed and you also roll on the <b>Oops! Table</b> (WFRP p. 160) to
                determine what very unfortunate thing has occurred to you.
            <div class="w3-round-large w3-panel w3-light-blue w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-blue">
                <h5>Misfires</h5>
                <p>If you are using a <b>Blackpowder</b>, <b>Engineering</b>, or <b>Explosive</b> weapon and suffer a
                    Fumble that is also an even number (for example, 00 or 88), you suffer a Misfire as your weapon
                    explodes in your hand.</p>
                <p>Take full Damage to your Primary Arm location, using the units die as an effective SL for the hit.
                    Additionally, your weapon is destroyed.</p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h5>Ranged Combat</h5>
            <p>
                Ranged combat has some additional rules that don't apply to melee combat:
                <li>Ranged attacks cannot be opposed with melee Skills unless the target has a large enough shield, or
                    if the shot is taken at Point Blank range. Shots at Point Blank range can also be dodged.</li>
                <li>You cannot make Ranged attacks whilst <condition>Engaged</condition>, unless your weapon has the
                    <weaponqual>Pistol</weaponqual> Quality.</li>
                <li>If you use your <skill>Ranged</skill> Skill when you are <condition>Engaged</condition> with your
                    target, the target may Oppose your attack with any Melee skill.</li>
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <p>
                Your movement distance (in yards) is calculated based on your Movement Characteristic. If you don't
                already have it calculated, your <b>Walk</b> speed is Movement &times; 2, and your <b>Run</b> speed is
                Movement &times; 4. In combat, you can move up to your Run speed without making a test. Moving beyond
                your Walk speed may cause penalties to Tests at the GM's discretion &mdash; this could include
                attempting to run stealthily, for example.
            </p>
            <h4>Charging</h4>
            <p>
                If you are not <condition>Engaged</condition> in combat already, you can use your Move to Charge. If you
                Charge, your Action must be a <skill>Melee</skill> Test to attack an opponent. If your opponent is at
                least your Move characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your Run range, you will also
                gain +1 Advantage as you barrel into your opponent.
            </p>
            <h4>Disengaging</h4>
            <p>
                If you are <condition>Engaged</condition> in combat and no longer wish to be, you have the following two
                options for leaving safely:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Use Advantage: </b>If you have more Advantage than your opponents, you may choose to drop your
                Advantage to 0 and move away without penalty.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Use Dodge: </b>If you have lower or equal Advantage to your opponents, or do not wish to spend your
                Advantage, you are pinned in place. If you wish to escape, you must make an <b>Opposed <skill>Dodge
                    </skill>/<skill>Melee</skill> Test</b>. If you succeed, you gain +1 Advantage and can use your Move
                as normal. If you fail, each opponent defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible to escape
                without a blow to your back.
            </p>
            <h5>Fleeing</h5>
            <p>
                If you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee from your opponents. This is often
                involuntary, caused by <trait>Terror</trait> or Magic.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you flee, your opponent immediately gains +1 Advantage and may attempt a free attack. The free attack
                is an <u>unopposed</u> Melee Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL to Damage you as
                normal. Melee Tests made to hit a Fleeing character gain a +20 bonus.
                <br />If you are hit, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and you must perform a <b>Challenging (+0)
                    <skill>Cool</skill> Test</b>. If you fail this test, you gain +1 <condition>Broken</condition>
                Condition, and a further +1 Broken Condition per SL below 0.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the free attack is resolved, you may move up to your Run speed directly away from your opponent,
                assuming you're still capable of such an act.
            </p>
            <h4>Running (Sprinting)</h4>
            <p>
                You may use your Action to sprint. Perform an <b>Average (+20) <skill>Athletics</skill> Test</b>, and
                add the SL to 2 &times; Run speed.
            <div class="w3-round-large w3-panel w3-light-blue w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-blue">
                <b>Example: </b>If your Movement characteristic is 4, your Run speed is 16 yards. If you scored -2 SL on
                your Athletics Test, your total Sprint speed would be <b><mono>(16 &times; 2) - 2 = 30</mono></b> yards.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    As with any other Tests, those made in combat are modified to reflect the effects of terrain, the
                    weather, and other factors. Below is a table with common difficulty examples; remember, the GM has
                    final say about the difficulty of any Test.
                </p>
                <h4>Helpless Targets</h4>
                <p>
                    Melee tests to hit a sleeping, <condition>Unconscious</condition>, or otherwise helpless target
                    automatically succeed.
                </p>
                <h4>Shooting into a Group</h4>
                <p>
                    <skill>Ranged</skill> Tests made to hit a group of targets are easier, so long as the shooter
                    doesn't care whom they hit. Any successful hits are randomised between all targets at the GM's
                    discretion. If the modifier allows you to hit when otherwise you would have failed, you succeed with
                    +0 SL.
                </p>
                <h4>Outnumbering</h4>
                <p>
                    Attacking a target whom you outnumber confers a bonus; additionally, at the end of every Round, all
                    outnumbered opponents lose 1 Advantage. Outnumbering is generally determined by how many Characters
                    are <condition>Engaged</condition> with each other.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
                <h3>Size</h3>
                <p>
                    Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a barn door than an
                    apple.
