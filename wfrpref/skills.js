You need only Test your Trade Skill if you are seeking to create something quickly, conditions are adverse, or you are seeking to invent or create a high-quality item. Often Trade Tests of this type are extended Test, with the SL and time required depending upon the scope or scale of what is being produced; a quick meal with Trade (Cook) to impress a local lord will take far less time than constructing a warship with Trade (Shipwright).</p> <p>You may also make a Trade Test as a Lore Skill, to determine information relevant to the trade in question. In such circumstances, the GM may prefer to use Int over Dex as the base Characteristic, though often this is ignored to keep play simple. While most Trade Skills have little function in combat, there are as many Trade Skills as there are trades, and some may be of use depending upon the circumstances. For example, a successful Trade (Apothecary) Test may be useful if fighting in an Apothecaryâ€™s shop as you identify some astringent chemicals to hurl at your foes.</p> <p>The Trade Skill is also used for enacting a Crafting Endeavour (see page 197).</p>"
