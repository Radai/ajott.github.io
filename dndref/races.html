                <h1>Races</h1>
                <p>Characters in D&D, in addition to a background and a class, have a race. This is an inherent part of
                    their being, though it is subject to change via magic. Your race is an integral part of character
                    creation, and each race has different advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                <p>Some races, such as Dwarves and Halflings, have sub-races. You must choose one of these sub-races
                    during
                    character creation. While all sub-races have the same basic characteristics of the overall race to
                    which they belong, they're often specialized in certain ways.</p>
                <p>As always, consult your DM to determine if a given race is a valid option for you to play in your
                    game. Races from supplemental materials are included here, some of which may not fit into your
                    campaign's setting.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p>
                    In <em>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</em>, WOTC outlined a new method of assigning ability score modifiers when selecting your character's race. Rather than comforming to the racial archetype shown, you may instead follow the steps outlined in this excerpt:
                    <br/>
                    <div style="border-left: 6px solid maroon; background-color: rgba(255, 228, 196, 0.6); color: black; padding-left: 2%; padding-right: 2%; padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                        <p>If you’d like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. </p>
                        
                        <p>Here’s how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can’t apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can’t increase a score above 20. </p>
 
                        <p><em>For example</em>, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.</div></p>

                                <emph>Trance: </emph>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
                                remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is
                                "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually
                                mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting
                                in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

                                <emph>Languages: </emph>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is
                                fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and
                                varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn
                                their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

                                Your Draconic Ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the
                                exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the
                                exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your
                                Draconic Ancestry.

                                <br />
                                The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level,
                                4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you

                                is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of
                                magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard
                                consonants and sibilants.

                            <h4>Draconic Ancestry</h4>
                            <p>Dragons have an association with a damage type or element as denoted by their color. In
                                addition, dragons can either be chromatic or metallic. Generally, metallic dragons are
                                Good while chromatic dragons are Evil. This isn't necessarily a factor during character
                                creation, but may be useful information for you.</p>

                            <p>
                                <emph>Change Appearance: </emph>As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.
                                <br/>
                                You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.
                                <br/>
                                Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <emph>Changeling Instincts: </emph>You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, Insight, Persuasion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <emph>Unsettling Visage: </emph>When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose Disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. 
                                <br/>
                                Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

                                <emph>Divergent Persona: </emph>You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a unique identity associated with that proficiency; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.

                            </p>
                            <p>

                                <emph>Mental Link: </emph>You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.
                                <br/>
                                As a bonus action when you're speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and be able to see you.

                                <emph>Severed from Dreams: </emph>Kalashtar sleep, but they don't connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to magical spells and effects that require you to dream, like the <emph>Dream</emph> spell, but not to spells and effects that put you to sleep, like the <emph>Sleep</emp> spell.

                                determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's
                                benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

                                modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
