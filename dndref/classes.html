                                    details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The
                                    information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its

                                    against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language
                                    with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds
                                    like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.
                                    <br />
                                    On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours, or
                                    until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw.
                                    It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain
                                    no knowledge of the secret.

                                    The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret.
                                    It won't risk its life for you, or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to
                                    do so.

                                    of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

                                    The thing you create can't have a value in excess of 100gp. As part of this ritual,
                                    you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation.
                                    The metal irretrievably coelesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's
                                    end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.
                                    <br />
                                    The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as
                                    a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

                                        As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.

                                        <br/>
                                        The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against <emph>your spell save DC</emph> or take 2d10 fire damage.
                                        <br />
                                        The wildfire spirit is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your
                                        commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the statblock below.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        You determine the spirit’s appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.
                                    </p>

                                        In combat, the wildfire spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or to take the Dash, Disengage, Help, or Hide action.
                                        <br />

                                        The wildfire spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

                                    You learn a ritual that creates a magic bond between yourself and
                                    one weapon. You
                                    perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
                                    during a short rest.
                                    The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the
                                    conclusion of
                                    which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

                                    summon that weapon as a bonus action, causing it to teleport to your
                                    hand.

                                    bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must

                                    bond with one of the other two.

                                    conjuration magic
                                    creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target.
                                    The creature hit
                                    by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced
                                    by 10 feet, and
                                    it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1
                                    foot or more
                                    without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it
                                    can use its action
                                    to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check
                                    against your
                                    Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or
                                    until you use this
                                    option again.

                                    your arrow an
                                    ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack
                                    roll for the
                                    attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot
                                    wide and 30 feet
                                    long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through
                                    objects, ignoring
                                    cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving
                                    throw. On a failed
                                    save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus
                                    an extra 1d6
                                    piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much
                                    damage.

                                    <emph>Seeking Arrow. </emph>Using divination magic, you grant your
                                    arrow the ability
                                    to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its
                                    path in search of
                                    its prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll
                                    for the attack.
                                    Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The
                                    arrow flies
                                    toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and
                                    ignoring three-quarters
                                    cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and
                                    there is a path
                                    large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must
                                    make a Dexterity
                                    saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by
                                    the arrow, plus
                                    an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target’s current
                                    location. On a
                                    successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t
                                    learn its
                                    location.

                                    occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the
                                    arrow takes an extra
                                    2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
                                    be unable to see
                                    anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

                                    Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells using Ki Points.
                                    To cast one of
                                    these spells, you follow the same rules for casting it normally, but
                                    do not need to
                                    provide material components.

                                    Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend Ki Points to
                                    cast spells at a
                                    higher level, provided the spell can be upcast in that manner. The
                                    spell is cast 1
                                    level higher for each additional Ki Point you spend.

                                    The maximum number of Ki Points you can spend increases as your Monk

                                    Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use; <emph>you must then finish a short or
                                    long rest before you can Channel Divinity again</emph>.

                                    You gain the following two Channel Divinity options:

                                    <br />
                                    <emph>Sacred Weapon. </emph>As an action, you can use your Channel
                                    Divinity to imbue
                                    one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. This effect
                                    lasts for 1
                                    minute. For the duration, you add your Charisma modifier (minimum
                                    +1) to attack
                                    rolls made with that weapon. The weapon also emits bright light in a
                                    20-foot radius,
                                    and dim light for 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already
                                    magical, it
                                    becomes magical for the duration.
                                    <br />
                                    You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If
                                    you are no
                                    longer holding or carrying the weapon, or if you fall unconscious,
                                    the effect ends.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <emph>Turn the Unholy. </emph>As an action, you present your holy

                                    Channel Divinity to censure fiends and undead. Each fiend or undead
                                    that can see or
                                    hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If
                                    the creature
                                    fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes
                                    damage.
                                    <br />
                                    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
                                    from you as it
                                    can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
                                    It also can't
                                    take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or
                                    try to escape
                                    from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to
                                    move, the
                                    creature can use the Dodge action.

                                    spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet
                                    of you that you
                                    can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving

                                    While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw

                                    each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines
                                    vanish.

                                    fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes

                                    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away

                                    It also can't
                                    take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or
                                    try to escape
                                    from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to
                                    move, the
                                    creature can use the Dodge action.

                                    If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion,

                                    effect, its true form is revealed while it is turned.

                                    Choose a beast
                                    that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of

                                    Your beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn
                                    on your
                                    initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it
                                    to. On your turn,
                                    you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required
                                    by you). You
                                    can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash,
                                    Disengage,
                                    Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the <emph>Extra Attack</emph>
                                    feature, you can
                                    make one weapon attack yourself when you command your beast to take
                                    the Attack
                                    action.

                                    <br />
                                    You never have to spend an action to have your companion use its Reaction (such as
                                    for an Opportunity Attack).
                                    <br />
                                    If you die or become incapacitated, your companion will act on its own, doing its
                                    best to protect you and itself.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast,
                                    you can move
                                    stealthily at a normal pace.
                                    <br />
                                    If your beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours
                                    magically bonding
                                    with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type
                                    of beast as

                                    affinity, as shown below. It counts as a Sorcerer spell for you, but

                                    against your number of Sorcerer spells known. If you later replace

                                    The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target.
                                    Additionally,
                                    while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has
                                    Disadvantage on

                                    The hound disappears if it is reduce to 0 hit points, if its target

                                    hit points, or after 5 minutes.

                                    Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you
                                    for 1 minute or
                                    more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you

                                    or if you die.

                                    You can perform a 1-hour-long ritual, which can be done during a

                                    to transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon. The weapon
                                    ceases to be your
                                    pact weapon if you die, if you perform the ritual on another weapon,
                                    or if you use a
                                    1-hour ritual to break the bond.

                                    is broken.

The interior is comfortably appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonusaction to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appearsin the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel’s former space.

The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

                                    The vessel’s AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

                                    If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

                                    Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.
                                    <br/>
                                    While you are holding the book, it grants youthe following benefits:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</li>
                                        <li>When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with the damage type of another spell in your spellbook, as your spellbook magically alters the spell’s formula for this casting. </li>
                                        <li>When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell’s normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you’re attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook’s consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.

                                    Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.

                                    The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd leveland must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell’s power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.

                                    You are now able to conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral construct, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice). The spectral mind has a number of hit points equal to your wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier, and it uses your Armor Class and saving throw modifiers.

                                    While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. As an action, you can hear and see using the its senses, instead of your own, until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell)

                                    Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind’s space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day <emph>equal to your proficiency bonus</emph>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                                    <br/>

                                    As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if it drops to 0 hit points, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

                                    Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While you are holding the book and its spectral mind is manifest, you can take an action to cause the two of you to teleport, swapping places. You can teleport in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                                    Moreover, if you die but at least one spell remains in your Awakened Spellbook, you can return to life 1 minute later within 5 feet of the book. You revive with 1 hit point. Then roll 3d6. The book loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll’s total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    Thereafter, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. The only way to restore your ability to cast one of the lost spells is through the wish spell, which can restore one spell to the book per casting.

                                    You can invest a spark of magic into objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use
                                    this feature, you must have thieves' tools, tinker's tools, or other artisan's tools
                                    in hand.

                                    As an action, you touch a Tiny nonmagical object and give it one of the following
                                    magical properties of your choice:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an
                                            additional 5 feet.</li>
                                        <li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can
                                            be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this
                                            property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds
                                            long.</li>
                                        <li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound
                                            (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable
                                            up to 10 feet away.</li>
                                        <li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect
                                            can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of
                                            these elements, as you like.</li>

                                    The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and
                                    end the property early.
                                    <br />
                                    You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each
                                    time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at
                                    a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is
                                    <emph>equal to your Intelligence modifier</emph> (minimum of one object). If you try
                                    to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new
                                    property applies.

                                    You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one
                                    object at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest
                                    infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

                                        Whenever you finish a long rest and your alchemist’s supplies are with you, you
                                        can form an alchemical homunculus in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.
                                        <br />
                                        If you already have a homunculus from this feature, the first one immediately
                                        dies.
                                        <br />
                                        The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your
                                        commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the statblock below.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        You determine the homunculus’s appearance, which includes wings and bits of
                                        alchemical equipment. Some alchemists prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas
                                        others like winged vials or miniature cauldrons.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
                                        immediately after yours.
                                        <br />
                                        The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a
                                        bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat
                                        block or to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        If the <emph>Mending</emph> spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points.
                                        <br />
                                        If it has died within the last hour, you can use your alchemist’s supplies as an
                                        action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell
                                        slot of 1st level or higher.
                                        <br />
                                        The homunculus returns to life with all its hit points restored.

                                        Whenever you finish a long rest and your calligrapher's supplies are with you,
                                        you can magically rouse a keen mind within a Tiny, nonmagical object on which
                                        you write mystical symbols.
                                        <br />
                                        The object is a magic item while the mind is inside it, and you can use it as a
                                        spellcasting focus.
                                        <br />
                                        If you already have an aritficial mind from this feature, the first one
                                        immediately dissapates
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The magic item has the following properties:
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <emph>Telepathic Advisor. </emph>While the item is on your person, you gain
                                        proficiency in two skills of your choice. The material from which you create the
                                        mind determines the list of skills you can choose from, as shown below.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <emph>Manifest Mind. </emph>As a bonus action while the item is on your person,
                                        you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral presence, hovering in an
                                        unoccupied space within 60 feet of you.
                                        <br />
                                        This presence is intangible and invulnerable, and it sheds dim light in a
                                        10-foot radius. You determine its appearance; the table below offers suggestions
                                        based on the material from which it was created.
                                        <br />
                                        While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with
                                        a range of 60 feet. As an action, you can hear and see using the mind’s senses,
                                        instead of your own, until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a
                                        spell).
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an
                                        unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not
                                        objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet
                                        away from its magic item or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

                                        <br />
                                        When you cast an artificer spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in
                                        the spectral mind’s space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so
                                        a number of times per day <emph>equal to your Intelligence modifier</emph> (at
                                        least once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <emph>Information Overload. </emph>As an action while the item is on your
                                        person, you can try to magically overload the thoughts of one creature you or
                                        the mind can see that is within 5 feet of the manifested mind.
                                        <br />
                                        Unless the target succeeds on an Intelligence saving throw against <emph>your
                                            spell save DC</emph>, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the next
                                        attack roll against it before the end of your next turn has advantage.
                                        <br />
                                        The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8),
                                        and 17th level (4d8) in this class.
                                        <br />
                                        Whenever you deal damage with this feature, you can expend a spell slot to deal
                                        extra damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot,
                                        plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than first.

                                    As an action, you can use the wand to produce the cantrip, using your spellcasting

                                    <br />
                                    Any damage rolls you make for a cantrip in the wand gains a bonus <emph>equal to
                                        your Intelligence modifier</emph> (minimum of +1).

                                        You have a faithful companion. It resembles a hound, a cougar, a bear, or
                                        another four-legged creature of your choice.
                                        <br />
                                        It is loyal to you and to your companions, and it obeys your commands.

                                        <br />
                                        In combat, the iron defender shares your initiative count, but takes its turn
                                        immediately after yours.
                                        <br />
                                        It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its
                                        turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command
                                        it to take one of the actions on its stat block, or the Dash, Disengage, or Help
                                        actions.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        If the <emph>Mending</emph> spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points.
                                        <br />
                                        If
                                        it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an
                                        action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell
                                        slot of 1st level or higher. The iron defender returns to life after 1 minute
                                        with all its hit points restored.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        At the end of a long rest, you can create a new iron defender if you have your
                                        smith's tools with you. If you already have an iron defender from this feature,
                                        the first one immediately perishes.

You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.

                                        With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an <emph>ape</emph>, a <emph>black bear</emph>, a <emph>boar</emph>, a <emph>giant badger</emph>, a <emph>giant weasel</emph>, a <emph>mule</emph>, a <emph>panther</emph>, or a <emph>wolf</emph>.

                                        At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

                                    <p>
                                        If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion’s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.

                                        If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.

                                        The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.
                                        <br/>
                                        When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.

                                        Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
                                        <br/>
                                        Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.
                                        <br/>
                                        For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
                                    </p>

                                        Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.
